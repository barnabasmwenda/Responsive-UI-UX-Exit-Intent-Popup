# Responsive-Exit-Intent-Popup
This custom designed modal allows dismissal by clicking outside or using the 'Dismiss' button. It saves the dismissal preference ('Dismiss and don't show again') in the browser's Local Storage.

# How does it work?
Exit intent works by tracking user behavior, detecting when a visitor is about to leave a webpage, and triggering a targeted popup or message at that critical moment. By analyzing mouse movement or scrolling patterns, it detects exit intent, prompting timely interventions like special offers or subscription prompts to re-engage users before they leave.
